# Meal Search App

**Meal Search App** is a mobile application designed to search meals based on ingredients available. The application leverages a web service built using Java Servlets that interacts with TheMealDB API to fetch meal data, display search results, and log user interactions for analytics.

## Features

- **Search Meals by Ingredient**: Enter ingredients to discover related meals.
- **Dynamic Search Results**: Displays meal images, names, and country of origin in a user-friendly RecyclerView format.
- **Recipe Integration**: Click on any meal to open its recipe in the browser.
- **Search Analytics Dashboard**: A web-based dashboard displays the top 10 most-searched ingredients along with the number of search requests.
- **Persistent Logging**: Logs all user queries into MongoDB with real-time updates for analytics.

## Components

### 1. Native Android Application
- **Name**: MealDBDemo
- **Views Used**:
  - `TextView`, `EditText`, `ImageView`, `Button`, `RecyclerView`
- **Functionalities**:
  - Accept user input for meal ingredients.
  - Send search queries via HTTP POST to a web service.
  - Display results dynamically using RecyclerView.
  - Allow users to view meal recipes through external links.
- **Reusability**: Clears the input field after each search for continuous interaction.

### 2. Web Service
- **Hosted On**: GitHub Codespaces
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST`: Fetch meal data from TheMealDB API.
  - `GET`: Retrieve search analytics for the dashboard.
- **Business Logic**:
  - Parses queries from the Android app, fetches data from the MealDB API, and returns a structured JSON response.
  - Logs all search queries into MongoDB, incrementing counters for repeated queries.
- **MongoDB Logging**:
  - Tracks unique queries and maintains a counter for the number of search requests.

### 3. Dashboard
- **Features**:
  - Displays top 10 most-searched ingredients.
  - Shows the number of requests for each ingredient.
  - Logs detailed request and response data for each search query.
- **Deployment**: Accessible through a URL generated by GitHub Codespaces.
